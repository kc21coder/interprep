        <p className="question">What is Docker, and how does it differ from traditional virtualization?</p>
        <p>Answer: Docker is an open-source platform that allows you to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using containerization. Unlike traditional virtualization, Docker operates at the operating system (OS) level rather than emulating an entire physical machine. Docker containers share the host OS kernel, making them lightweight and efficient. Containers provide isolation, portability, and reproducibility, enabling applications to run consistently across different environments.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p className="question">What are the key components of Docker architecture?</p>
        <p>Answer: Docker architecture consists of three main components: Docker Engine, Docker Images, and Docker Containers.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Docker Engine is the runtime that runs and manages Docker containers. It consists of a server (Docker daemon) and a client (Docker CLI) that interact with each other.</li>
          <li>Docker Images are read-only templates that contain everything needed to run an application, including the code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies.</li>
          <li>Docker Containers are the instances of Docker Images. They are lightweight, isolated, and portable, encapsulating the application and its dependencies. Multiple containers can run simultaneously on a single host.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p className="question">What is the purpose of Docker Compose, and how is it used?</p>
        <p>Answer: Docker Compose is a tool that allows you to define and run multi-container Docker applications. It uses a YAML file to specify the services, networks, and volumes required for your application stack. With Docker Compose, you can define the configuration once and then use a simple command to start and manage your entire application stack. It simplifies the process of managing complex, multi-container applications by providing a declarative way to define and orchestrate the containers relationships and dependencies.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p className="question">How does Docker facilitate continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD)?</p>
        <p>Answer: Docker plays a significant role in CI/CD pipelines by providing consistent environments and enabling efficient packaging and deployment of applications.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reproducible Builds: Docker images encapsulate the application and its dependencies, ensuring that the build process is consistent across different environments, minimizing discrepancies and potential issues during deployment.</li>
          <li>Scalable Testing: Docker allows you to create isolated testing environments using containers, enabling parallel and scalable testing of different components or versions of the application.</li>
          <li>Container Orchestration: Docker Swarm or Kubernetes can be used to manage and orchestrate containers in a distributed environment, providing features like scaling, load balancing, and automated deployments.</li>
          <li>Container Registry: Docker Hub or other private container registries can be used to store and distribute container images, making it easy to share and deploy applications across different stages of the CI/CD pipeline.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p className="question">How can Docker improve scalability and resource utilization in a production environment?</p>
        <p>Answer: Docker provides several features that improve scalability and resource utilization.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Containerization: Containers enable applications to run in isolated environments, allowing for easy scaling by spinning up additional instances of the same containerized application. Containers can be quickly deployed, scaled, and migrated across different hosts or cloud providers.</li>
          <li>Horizontal Scaling: Dockers container orchestration tools like Docker Swarm or Kubernetes help manage multiple container instances, allowing for automatic load balancing and scaling based on demand.</li>
          <li>Resource Efficiency: Dockers lightweight architecture ensures efficient resource utilization by running multiple containers on the same host without the overhead of virtual machines. Containers start and stop quickly, making it easier to scale based on demand and optimize resource allocation.</li>
          <li>Microservices Architecture: Docker lends itself well to a microservices architecture, where applications are broken down into smaller, independent services. Each service can be scaled individually, allowing for better resource allocation and improved overall performance.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
