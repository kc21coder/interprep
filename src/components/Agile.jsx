        <h1>Agile Methodology</h1>
 <ol>
    <li>
      <h2>What is Agile methodology, and what are its core principles?</h2>
      <p>Agile methodology is an iterative and collaborative approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility, adaptability, and customer collaboration. Its core principles include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</li>
        <li>Working software over comprehensive documentation</li>
        <li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation</li>
        <li>Responding to change over following a plan</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>How does Agile methodology differ from traditional Waterfall methodology?</h2>
      <p>Agile methodology differs from the traditional Waterfall methodology in several ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Iterative Approach: Agile follows an iterative and incremental development approach, while Waterfall follows a sequential, linear approach.</li>
        <li>Flexibility: Agile embraces change and encourages adaptation to evolving requirements, while Waterfall assumes fixed requirements upfront.</li>
        <li>Customer Involvement: Agile emphasizes continuous customer collaboration throughout the development process, while Waterfall involves customer feedback mainly at the beginning and end.</li>
        <li>Deliverables: Agile delivers working software in short iterations, while Waterfall delivers the final product at the end of the development cycle.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>What are the key roles in Agile development teams?</h2>
      <p>The key roles in Agile development teams typically include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Product Owner: Represents the customerS interests, defines the product vision, and prioritizes the product backlog.</li>
        <li>Scrum Master: Facilitates the Agile process, ensures adherence to Agile principles, and helps the team remove any obstacles or impediments.</li>
        <li>Development Team: Cross-functional team members responsible for developing, testing, and delivering the product increment.</li>
        <li>Stakeholders: Individuals or groups with an interest or influence in the project, such as customers, end-users, managers, or executives.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>How does Agile address risk management in software development?</h2>
      <p>Agile methodology addresses risk management through the following practices:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Iterative Development: Frequent iterations allow for early identification and mitigation of risks. Risks can be addressed and adjusted in subsequent iterations.</li>
        <li>Continuous Feedback: Regular feedback from stakeholders and customers helps identify and address potential risks early in the development process.</li>
        <li>Adaptive Planning: Agile allows for changes and adjustments based on evolving risks, ensuring that the project remains on track.</li>
        <li>Incremental Delivery: Delivering increments of working software provides opportunities to validate assumptions, identify risks, and make necessary adjustments.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>What are the main ceremonies in Agile methodology?</h2>
      <p>The main ceremonies in Agile methodology include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sprint Planning: The team plans the work to be done during the upcoming sprint, defines the sprint goal, and decides on the backlog items to be included.</li>
        <li>Daily Stand-up: A short daily meeting where team members discuss progress, challenges, and plans for the day.</li>
        <li>Sprint Review: The team demonstrates the completed work to stakeholders, gathers feedback, and discusses potential improvements.</li>
        <li>Sprint Retrospective: The team reflects on the sprint, identifies what went well and what can be improved, and makes adjustments for the next sprint.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
