      <h2>What is the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), and what are its phases?</h2>
      <p>The SDLC is a systematic process used to develop software applications. It consists of several phases:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Requirements Gathering: In this phase, project stakeholders define and document the software requirements, including functional and non-functional requirements.</li>
        <li>Analysis and Design: In this phase, the system architecture and design are planned. The software components, data structures, and user interfaces are designed based on the requirements.</li>
        <li>Implementation: This phase involves coding and development. The actual software product is built using the chosen programming language or framework.</li>
        <li>Testing: In this phase, the developed software is systematically tested for defects and bugs. Different types of testing, such as unit testing, integration testing, and system testing, are conducted to ensure software quality.</li>
        <li>Deployment: Once the software is tested and approved, it is deployed to the production environment or made available to end-users.</li>
        <li>Maintenance: This phase involves ongoing support, bug fixing, and enhancements based on user feedback and evolving requirements.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>What are the advantages of following the SDLC in software development?</h2>
      <p>Following the SDLC provides several advantages:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Improved Quality: The SDLC promotes systematic testing and quality assurance, resulting in higher-quality software products that meet user requirements.</li>
        <li>Predictable Timeline and Cost: The SDLC helps in estimating and managing project timelines and costs more effectively by providing a structured approach to development.</li>
        <li>Clear Communication: The SDLC provides a common framework and language for developers, stakeholders, and project managers to communicate and collaborate throughout the development process.</li>
        <li>Risk Mitigation: The SDLC allows for early identification and mitigation of risks and issues, reducing the chances of project failure or unexpected problems during development.</li>
        <li>Scalability and Maintainability: Following the SDLC ensures proper documentation, modular design, and adherence to coding standards, making the software easier to scale and maintain in the long run.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>What are the key deliverables of the SDLC?</h2>
      <p>The key deliverables of the SDLC vary based on the specific methodology and project, but some common deliverables include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Requirements Document: A document that captures the functional and non-functional requirements of the software.</li>
        <li>Design Documents: Documents that detail the system architecture, database design, and user interface design.</li>
        <li>Source Code: The actual code files developed during the implementation phase.</li>
        <li>Test Plans and Test Cases: Documentation outlining the test strategies, plans, and specific test cases to be executed during the testing phase.</li>
        <li>User Documentation: Guides or manuals that provide instructions on how to use and maintain the software.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>How does the SDLC relate to Agile methodologies such as Scrum or Kanban?</h2>
      <p>Agile methodologies like Scrum or Kanban are iterative and incremental approaches to software development. They emphasize flexibility, collaboration, and continuous delivery. The SDLC can be adapted to fit within an Agile framework, where the traditional phases are broken down into smaller, iterative cycles. Each cycle includes planning, development, testing, and deployment activities, allowing for faster feedback and adaptation to changing requirements.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>What are some challenges or risks associated with the SDLC?</h2>
      <p>Some common challenges or risks associated with the SDLC include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Scope Creep: The tendency for the project scope to expand beyond the original requirements, leading to delays and increased costs.</li>
        <li>Inadequate Requirements Gathering: Insufficient or unclear requirements can lead to misunderstandings, rework, and poor software quality.</li>
        <li>Lack of Communication and Collaboration: Ineffective communication and collaboration among team members, stakeholders, or across different phases can result in misalignment and project delays.</li>
        <li>Inadequate Testing: Insufficient or inadequate testing can lead to undetected defects or bugs, impacting softwarequality and user satisfaction.</li>
        <li>Change Management: Managing changes in requirements or scope during the development process can be challenging, requiring proper change management processes to avoid disruption.</li>
      </ul>
