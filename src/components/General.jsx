  嗨，我係Kevin，係英國出生嘅。我修咗一個全面嘅IT軟件開發課程，對軟件開發有好好嘅基礎。我對科技好有興趣，而且有好多IT嘅背景，了解行業嘅好多方面。
我學習期間，主動探索同熟悉咗好多唔同嘅技術堆疊，包括（提及你有經驗嘅具體技術堆疊）。咁樣令我有好多技能同埋可以快速學習新嘅科技同程式語言。
我自己係一個好有動力嘅人，經常學習同追求行業嘅最新趨勢。我會參加網上課程、睇科技文章同埋參加編程挑戰，係希望自己可以不斷進步同保持對呢個快速發展嘅領域有追求。
我相信好好嘅軟件開發基礎同埋對學習有心態係好重要嘅，特別係喺呢個不斷變化嘅行業度。我好期待有機會可以喺miniwork度發揮我嘅技能同知識，同團隊一齊為成功出一分力。
多謝你考慮我嘅申請，我好期待同你討論我嘅經驗同miniwork嘅目標同願景點樣吻合。
